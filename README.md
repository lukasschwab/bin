# bin

A potpourri of scripts.

## Fresh machine

You may need to start by installing developer tools.

1. Install oh-my-zsh.
2. Clone the af-magic-custom theme in `~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/themes`.
2. Replace the boilerplate .zshrc with `source ~/bin/binrc`.

## Common tools

These are either dependencies of scripts in this directory, or else just software I use regularly.

## Docs

<!-- GENERATEDCONTENT -->

### `al`

```
al opens the lexicographically last file in a directory with atom.
The custom exemptions might become unwieldy; this may not be extensible.
```

### `bashdoc`

```
bashdoc prints the contents of a file until the first blank line.
This is useful for bash scripts that begin with documentation before the code,
which I aim to standardize in bin. This way, I can use bashdoc to echo help
strings without replicating them.

Usage:
  bashdoc <filename>

Examples:
  # Print the bashdoc for some bash utility.
  bashdoc phone
  # Print the bashdoc for the current script.
  bashdoc "$BASH_SOURCE"
```

### `blog`

```
blog is a limited bash leveled-logging utility.

Usage:
  blog [debug|info|warn|error] <message>

  blog warn "Here is a warning. Hmm..."
  blog error "Ack, an error! Oh no!"
