## Docs

<!-- GENERATEDCONTENT -->

### `al`

```
al opens the lexicographically last file in a directory with atom.
The custom exemptions might become unwieldy; this may not be extensible.
```

### `bashdoc`

```
bashdoc prints the contents of a file until the first blank line.
This is useful for bash scripts that begin with documentation before the code,
which I aim to standardize in bin. This way, I can use bashdoc to echo help
strings without replicating them.

Usage:
  bashdoc <filename>

Examples:
  # Print the bashdoc for some bash utility.
  bashdoc phone
  # Print the bashdoc for the current script.
  bashdoc "$BASH_SOURCE"
```

### `blog`

```
blog is a limited bash leveled-logging utility.

Usage:
  blog [info|warn|error] <message>

Examples:
  blog info "Here is some useful info."
  blog warn "Here is a warning. Hmm..."
  blog error "Ack, an error! Oh no!"
```

### `croppedhistory`

```
croppedhistory removes the line numbers from history output for deduping.
It also does some stuff I don't fully understand, because I wrote it when
I first wrote hg.
```

### `dcover`

```
dcover checks the coverage impact of merging the current Go monorepo branch
into main.

Uses colordiff: https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/colordiff

Example:
  git checkout featurebranch
  dcover
```

### `feedscan`

```
Feedscan checks common feed suffixes for a webpage.

Usage:
  feedscan [url]

Examples:
  feedscan lukasschwab.me/blog
  feedscan lukasschwab.me/blog/
  feedscan http://lukasschwab.me/blog/
  feedscan https://lukasschwab.me/blog/
```

### `gofind`

```
Find the path to a package buried in your GOPATH.
Uses fzf: https://github.com/junegunn/fzf

To conveniently cd to the found directory, set a function in your .zshrc:
  goto() { cd $(gofind) }
```

### `gore`

```
GO RElease: routine checks for go packages.
```

### `gsl`

```
fzf search on the files in `git status` output.
Uses fzf: https://github.com/junegunn/fzf

Usage, e.g.:
  gsl diff
  gsl add
  gsl checkout - check out files
  gsl -b checkout - check out branches

Use TAB to multiselect in `fzf`.
```

### `hf`

```
hf pipes history into fzf for finding commands you can't remember.
```

### `hg`

```
hg pipes history into grep for finding commands you can't remember.
```

### `lsf`

```
lsf pipes ls results into fzf.

Standard useage:
	lsf
List all files:
	lsf -a
```

### `mainbranch`

```
mainbranch returns "main" if the current git repository has a branch named
"main." Otherwise, if the repostiory has a branch named "master," mainbranch
returns "master."
```

### `margins`

```
margins shrinks PDF contents by 20% and splats them into a letter-size page
to add margins to them.

NOTE: this operation is not in-place; a copy of the PDF is created.

Uses pdfscale: https://github.com/tavinus/pdfScale

Usage: `margins some.pdf`
  Yields some.LETTER.SCALED.pdf.
```

### `pdfcat`

```
pdfcat uses PhantomJS to retrieve websites as PDFs, then catenates the PDFs
into a single PDF with Ghostscript. Spooky!

Usage: pdfcat https://scrty.io/start-here \
  https://medium.com/starting-up-security/starting-up-security-87839ab21bae \
  ... any number of URLs.
```

### `phone`

```
Uses Twilio to notify me of a long task completing.
e.g.:
   $ gcloud app deploy; phone
Setup:
   Set up Twilio API/CLI: https://www.twilio.com/docs/twilio-cli/quickstart
   Add two variables to .zshrc:
      TWILIO_NUMBER="+1234567890"   # A number from which Twilio can send.
      PERSONAL_NUMBER="+0987654321" # The number that will be notified.
```

### `semvercompare`

```
semvercompare compares two semantic versions with the same number of
components.

Usage: semvercompare <v0> <v1>
  semvercompare 1.2.10 1.3.10

  0 - when v0 and v1 are the same
 -1 - when v0 is earlier than v1
```

### `tikz2svg`

Example input: https://gist.github.com/lukasschwab/6a3e2cdd78075e8923a9057f7609a898
