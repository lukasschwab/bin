# gitclean proposes branches to delete (GitHub remote). Requires gh, gum.

# Usage:
#   gitclean

# NOTE: there's a good deal of gross formatting in this script, but it's all
# really for appearances. Key operation: prune remote refs, then suggest
# deleting branches that *have* a push branch defined but that branch no longer
# exists.
